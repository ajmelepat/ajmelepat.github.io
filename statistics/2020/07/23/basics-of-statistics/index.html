It was developed in the 17th to 19th centuries. Challenges in the areas of data analysis and organisation have been given a scope due to the statistical influence in data science. Vast amounts of data is being generated and it is the job of the researcher to make sense of the data. It helps us understand the main question “What does the data tell?”</p> <p>Statistics can be divided into three categories:</p> <ol> <li>Descriptive statistics: The statistical measures that help describe the data. Often used to present the results.</li> <li>Inferential Statistics: The statistics that uses the descriptive measures to infer the data and patterns related.</li> <li>Predictive Statistics: The statists that help predict the event based on the inferences from the inferential and the descriptive statistics.</li> </ol> <p>Main terminologies in statistics:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Population: The complete set of observations that belong in the study based on the criteria chosen. e.g. People who smoke in Hyderabad of age 20 It includes all people with age 20 and from Hyderabad and they smoke.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sample: The part of a population which has been extracted or selected such that it represents the population that is it follows the same criteria as the population. It is usually selected through different means as selecting the entire population is computationally impossible. e.g. From the same example from population where criteria are people of age 20 from Hyderabad who smoke. In this we select a part of population of about let’s say 20000 people who are of age 20, from Hyderabad and smoke.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameter: The characteristics of a population are called parameter. e.g. mean of population is denoted as “μ “ standard deviation is denoted as “σ “</p> </li> <li> <p>Statistic: The characteristics of a sample are called statistic. e.g. mean of a sample is denoted as “x̄” standard deviation is denoted as “s”</p> </li> <li> <p>Variable: A temporary storage where we can store the values. e.g. x = 5 here, x is called the variable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Experiment: The activity which has a result is called an experiment or survey. e.g. tossing a coin has a result of head or tail. The tossing is called the experiment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Outcome: The result of an experiment is called as an outcome. e.g. When a coin is tossed, and we get a head. The head is the outcome of the experiment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Frequency: The count of the number of observations in that category or the interval.</p> </li> <li> <p>Outliers: The values that are inconsistent with data are called outliers. e.g. if manual labour earns between 10 and 50 maxima but can never earn more than it, but a data shows a person with 1000 as the income that is said to be an outlier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extreme Values: The value that are very low or very high are called extreme values. They are not actually outliers as they stay consistent with the remaining part of the data. e.g. if any manual labour earns anywhere between 10 to 50 in general. But a person earns 55 then it would be an extreme value.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Sampling Methods</p> <p>The methods used to select the data from the population. A sample frame is the elements belonging to a population from which we are extracting the sample. A sample design is the procedure we use to select the elements from the sample frame. The selection methods can be of two different types in general:</p> <ol> <li>Probabilistic sampling The sampling where each observation has an equal probability of selection.</li> <li>Non-probabilistic sampling The sampling where observations do not share an equal probability of being a part of the sample.</li> </ol> <p>Probabilistic Sampling The sampling methods can be further classified into</p> <ol> <li> <p>Simple Random Sampling In this method of sampling, we randomly select the sample without any procedure associated to the selection. Advantages: very easy, highly random. Disadvantages: might not be a right representation of population.</p> </li> <li> <p>Systematic Sampling In this method of sampling, we select the sample using a system. Like selection at regular intervals. e.g. selecting every 10th element in the data. Advantages: easy, efficient Disadvantages: if any underlying pattern (cycle or repetitive) exists, it will not be a good method as it will be biased. For instance, if every 10th observation has diabetes then all the sample will be of diabetic people.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stratified Sampling This method first groups the data into strata based on similar characteristics. From each stratum randomly data is selected. Advantages: reduction in bias. Disadvantages: prior knowledge in creating the strata.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quota Sampling An extension of stratified sampling. It divides the data into strata. Then from each stratum it selects the data in such a proportion as the strata is to the population. Also called Proportional sampling e.g. Maths, Science, Social have 30%, 45% and 25% in the population. From the 3 strata created, of maths 30% is selected, of science 45% and of social 25%.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cluster Sampling This method is also an extension of stratified sampling. After the strata is created, it selects samples from only few strata but not all of them. Advantages: efficiency, Disadvantages: Sampling and bias errors</p> </li> </ol> <p>TYPES OF DATA The data can be numerical or categorical in general.</p> <p>Quantitative (Numerical): The data which is numerical in nature is called as quantitative data. It can be again categorised into discrete and continuous. Discrete: When the data can take only integer forms. For instance, the count of people born on a day. It cannot be decimal and is finite. Continuous: The data which can take any value between the interval. For instance, height of a person can lie anywhere in an interval.</p> <p>Qualitative (Categorical): The data which is in the form of levels is called as qualitative data. Nominal: The data which do not have an order associated to them. It can be binomial or multinomial. Binomial is when there are only two categories in the data. e.g. True/False, 0/1, male/female Multinomial is when there are more than two categories in the data. e.g. petrol/ diesel/ gas Ordinal: The data with categories where the categories have an order associated with them. e.g. small/ medium/ large</p> <p> </p> <p>DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS</p> <p>The data can be described using different measures to understand the data. They can further classify as</p> <ol> <li>Measures of central tendency</li> <li>Measures of dispersion</li> </ol> <p>Measures of Central Tendency The measures of central tendency describe where the central part of the data lies.</p> <ol> <li>Mean The mean is also called the average. It tells us the division point for the data. It is given as the sum of observations divided by the number of observations.</li> </ol> <p>Mean = sum of observations / number of observations</p> <p>It is a calculated field. Mean is very sensitive to the extreme values and is not considered a best metric to understand the data.</p> <p>13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 Mean = 13+18+13+14+13+16+14+21+13 / 9 = 15</p> <ol> <li>Median The median is the middle most value in the distribution of the data.</li> </ol> <p>Sort the data in ascending order If number of observations is odd, Median = n+1/2 th observation If number of observations is even. Median = average of n/2 th observation and n/2 +1 th observation</p> <p>13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18, 21 N = 9 Median = 9+1/2 = 5th observation = 14</p> <p>It is a positional field. Median is also subject to outliers or extreme values. It is affected by extreme values but not as much as the mean. Hence is a better metric than the mean in situations where mean is not a good metric.</p> <ol> <li>Mode The most frequent value in the data is called as mode. It is a metric used for categorical features. It is not usually considered in case of numerical features. Unimodal: The data with only one mode Bimodal: The data with two modes Multimodal: The data with more than two modes</li> </ol> <p>13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 13 – 4 14 – 2 16 – 1 18 – 1 21 – 1 Mode = 13</p> <p>It is neither calculated nor a positional field. Mode is not subject to outliers or extreme values. It is not affected by extreme values like mean or median.</p> <p>Measures of dispersion The measures of dispersion describe the spread of data that is it helps understand how the data is distributed</p> <ol> <li>Range The range is the difference between minimum and the maximum values in the data.</li> </ol> <p>Range = Maximum – Minimum</p> <p>13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 Range = 21-13 = 7</p> <p>It is affected by outliers in the data. Hence is not considered a good measure for understanding the data.</p> <ol> <li>Deviation The difference between the observed value and the estimate of the location usually the mean. They are also called as Errors or Residuals.</li> </ol> <p>Deviation = Observed value – Estimate</p> <p>13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 Mean = 15 13 - 15 = -2 14 – 15 = -1 16 – 15 =1 18 – 15 =3 21 – 15 =6</p> <ol> <li>Standard deviation This measure how deviated the observations are from the mean and from each other.</li> </ol> <p>Standard deviation of population:</p> <p>Statistical deviation of sample:</p> <p>Standard deviation is also affected by the outliers. Since it calculated the deviations which are also affected by the outliers.</p> <p>We use n-1 to calculate for sample measures rather than n to account for the degrees of freedom. Using n with undercalculate the statistic but with n-1 will be a better explanation. The degrees of freedom are the number of observations which can be varied that is which can be moved freely. N-1 accounts to the observations that can move freely as one observation is kept constant.</p> <ol> <li>Variance: The variance is also a spread of the data. It tells us on an average how deviated are the data points from the mean.</li> </ol> <p>Variance = standard deviation ^ 2</p> <ol> <li>Quartile: The data when divided into 4 equal parts gives us the quartiles. It is one of the measures of calculating the extreme values in the data. Ever quartile has equal number of observations. They contain 25% of the observations.</li> </ol> <p>1st quartile = n+1/4 th observation 2nd quartile = Median = n+1/2 th observation 3rd quartile = 3(n+1)/4 th observation.</p> <ol> <li>Inter quartile range The interquartile range is the difference between the third and the first quartiles. It tells us where the 50% of the data lies.</li> </ol> <p>IQR = 3rd quartile – 1st quartile</p> <p>It is considered as one of the methods to remove the extreme values in the data. It is given as</p> <p>Lower limit = 1st quartile – 1.5<em>IQR Upper limit = 3rd quantile + 1.5</em>IQR</p> <p>Any value lower than lower limits or any value greater than the upper limit is considered as outliers.</p> <ol> <li>Skewness The skewness is the measure of the asymmetry of the data. Any data can have different kinds of distributions like normal, binomial etc. In case of normal distribution, the skewness = 0 since there symmetry around the mean.</li> </ol> <p>Skewness = 3(Mean-Median) / standard deviation</p> <p>Skewness can be of two types: Right skewness / Positive skewness: skewness&gt;0 Mean &gt; Median &gt;Mode It happens when there are few extreme values on the right tail of the data. Left skewness / Negative skewness: Skewness&lt;0 Mean&lt; Median&lt; Mode It happens when there are few extreme values on the left side of the data</p> <p>No skewness: Skewness =0 Mean = Median = Mode It happens when data is normally distributed</p> <ol> <li>Kurtosis It is a measure of tailedness or the peakedness in the data. It tells us what kind of distribution the data has.</li> </ol> <p>Positive kurt: Leptokurtic: Kurt &gt;3 Excess kurt &gt;0 Excess kurt =kurt -3 When the data is leptokurtic then the data lies very near to the mean or in other words, the standard deviation is low. Lepto means skinny and the distribution looks like a long peak. It indicates that the extreme values or outliers are large.</p> <p>Mesokurtic: No kurt: Kurt = 3 Excess kurt =0 When the data is mesokurtic then the data lies symmetric around the mean, in other words it is normally distributed. It indicates that there are no outliers or extreme values in the data</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Platykurtic: Negative kurt:
Kurt &lt;3
Excess kurt &lt;0 When the data is platykurtic then the data lies far from the mean, in other words the standard deviation is high. Platy means broad and hence distribution looks like a broad distribution. It indicates that the extreme values or outliers are small.
</code></pre></div></div> <ol> <li>Covariance The covariance is a measure of direction of movement of the variable in respect to each other.</li> </ol> <p>It only tells us the direction of movement of the variables with each other It is not interpretable. It can be positive or negative. When covariance &gt;0 then with an increase in one variable there will be an increase in the other variable When covariance &lt;0 then with increase in one variable there will be a decrease in the other variable</p> <ol> <li>Correlation Also called the coefficient of covariance This is a measure of both the direction and the magnitude of the movement of the variables in respect of each other.</li> </ol> <p>Correlation is preferred to covariance as it is interpretable. It always lies between -1 and 1 If correlation =0 then there is no relation between the variables If correlation =1 then with a unit increase in one variable there is a unit increase in another variable. If correlation =-1 then with a unit increase in one variable there is a unit decrease in another variable.</p> <p>Correlation does not mean causation. Causation means an evet that happens because another event happens that is it is a pre-established relationship. Correlation only implies statistically they move but not as a cause is involved.</p> <p> </p> <p>DATA VSUALISATION The visualisation of any data will help uncover better patterns in the data. And for any person visualisation is a better technique to understand the data.</p> <ol> <li>Histogram The plot shows the distribution of the data which is numerical in nature. It plots the intervals against their distributions. The bins are of equal width. Number of bins is dependent on the user. The height of the bin is the frequency. x-axis = interval y-axis = frequency</li> </ol> <p>2 14 14 14 16 18 20 20 21 23 27 27 27 29 31 31 32 32 34 36 40 40 40 40 40 42 51 56 60 65</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Step1: calculate range
Range = 65-12=53

Step2: Divide range into number of groups and round up

53/6 = 8.8 ~9

Step3: Use class width to create the groups

It plots the frequency against the category. X – axis = category Y – axis = frequency</li> </ol> <p>Category Frequency G1 1 G2 2 G3 3 G4 4 G5 5</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li>Pie charts The pie charts are circular graphs that show the distribution of the categories in the variable based on their percentages. It plots the percentage of total observations for each category. There are no axes to the chart 100% = 360 degrees in a pie chart Sum of all the observation frequency percentages is 100%.</li> </ol> <p>Fruit Percentage Peach 10 Orange 13 Pineapple 20 Grapes 27 Banana 30</p> <ol> <li>Box plots One of the plots used to view the numerical data. It is called the box and whiskers plot. It is called as 5-summary plot It includes: Lower limit 1st quartile Median 3rd quartile Upper limit</li> </ol> <p>If the minimum and maximum values lie below the limits of the IQR range, then we cannot see the points after the whiskers (lines) in the plot. But if the values lie above and below the limits, we can use this to see how they are distributed. In such case minimum value = least value point and maximum value = highest point in the graph.</p> <ol> <li>Scatter plots The graph shows the relationship between the two continuous features. It helps us understand how two features are related to each other.</li> </ol> <p>X – axis = one variable Y – axis = another variable</p> <br /><!-- Load Facebook SDK for JavaScript --> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script> (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.0"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); })(document, "script", "facebook-jssdk"); </script> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" ></script> <div class="share-page"> <p class="share-text">Share this on &rarr;</p> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-share-button" data-size="large" data-show-count="false" style="margin-top:5px;" >Tweet</a > <a class="fb-share-button" data-href="/statistics/2020/07/23/basics-of-statistics/" data-size="large" data-layout="button" >Share</a> </div></div><div class="comments"><!-- Hyvor Comments.

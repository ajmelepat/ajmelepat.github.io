&lt;p&gt;Statistics plays a very crucial part in understanding the data. It was developed in the 17th to 19th centuries. Challenges in the areas of data analysis and organisation have been given a scope due to the statistical influence in data science. Vast amounts of data is being generated and it is the job of the researcher to make sense of the data. It helps us understand the main question “What does the data tell?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics can be divided into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Descriptive statistics: The statistical measures that help describe the data. Often used to present the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inferential Statistics: The statistics that uses the descriptive measures to infer the data and patterns related.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictive Statistics: The statists that help predict the event based on the inferences from the inferential and the descriptive statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main terminologies in statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Population: The complete set of observations that belong in the study based on the criteria chosen.
e.g. People who smoke in Hyderabad of age 20
It includes all people with age 20 and from Hyderabad and they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample: The part of a population which has been extracted or selected such that it represents the population that is it follows the same criteria as the population. It is usually selected through different means as selecting the entire population is computationally impossible.
e.g. From the same example from population where criteria are people of age 20 from Hyderabad who smoke.
In this we select a part of population of about let’s say 20000 people who are of age 20, from Hyderabad and smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parameter:  The characteristics of a population are called parameter.
e.g. mean of population is denoted as “μ “ 
 standard deviation is denoted as “σ “&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statistic: The characteristics of a sample are called statistic.
e.g. mean of a sample is denoted as “x̄” 
 standard deviation is denoted as “s”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variable: A temporary storage where we can store the values.
e.g. x = 5 here, x is called the variable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experiment: The activity which has a result is called an experiment or survey.
e.g. tossing a coin has a result of head or tail.
The tossing is called the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outcome: The result of an experiment is called as an outcome.
e.g. When a coin is tossed, and we get a head.
The head is the outcome of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frequency:  The count of the number of observations in that category or the interval.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outliers: The values that are inconsistent with data are called outliers.
e.g. if manual labour earns between 10 and 50 maxima but can never earn more than it, but a data shows a person with 1000 as the income that is said to be an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extreme Values: The value that are very low or very high are called extreme values. They are not actually outliers as they stay consistent with the remaining part of the data.
e.g.  if any manual labour earns anywhere between 10 to 50 in general. But a person earns 55 then it would be an extreme value.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sampling Methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods used to select the data from the population.
A sample frame is the elements belonging to a population from which we are extracting the sample.
A sample design is the procedure we use to select the elements from the sample frame.
The selection methods can be of two different types in general:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probabilistic sampling
The sampling where each observation has an equal probability of selection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-probabilistic sampling
The sampling where observations do not share an equal probability of being a part of the sample.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic Sampling
The sampling methods can be further classified into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple Random Sampling
In this method of sampling, we randomly select the sample without any procedure associated to the selection.
Advantages: very easy, highly random.
Disadvantages: might not be a right representation of population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systematic Sampling
In this method of sampling, we select the sample using a system. Like selection at regular intervals.
e.g. selecting every 10th element in the data.
Advantages: easy, efficient
Disadvantages: if any underlying pattern (cycle or repetitive) exists, it will not be a good method as it will be biased.
For instance, if every 10th observation has diabetes then all the sample will be of diabetic people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stratified Sampling
This method first groups the data into strata based on similar characteristics. From each stratum randomly data is selected.
Advantages: reduction in bias.
Disadvantages: prior knowledge in creating the strata.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quota Sampling
An extension of stratified sampling. It divides the data into strata. Then from each stratum it selects the data in such a proportion as the strata is to the population.
Also called Proportional sampling
e.g. Maths, Science, Social have 30%, 45% and 25% in the population.
From the 3 strata created, of maths 30% is selected, of science 45% and of social 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cluster Sampling
This method is also an extension of stratified sampling. After the strata is created, it selects samples from only few strata but not all of them.
Advantages: efficiency,
Disadvantages: Sampling and bias errors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TYPES OF DATA
The data can be numerical or categorical in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative (Numerical): The data which is numerical in nature is called as quantitative data. It can be again categorised into discrete and continuous.
Discrete: When the data can take only integer forms. For instance, the count of people born on a day. It cannot be decimal and is finite.
Continuous: The data which can take any value between the interval. For instance, height of a person can lie anywhere in an interval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative (Categorical): The data which is in the form of levels is called as qualitative data.
Nominal: The data which do not have an order associated to them. It can be binomial or multinomial.
Binomial is when there are only two categories in the data.
e.g. True/False, 0/1, male/female
Multinomial is when there are more than two categories in the data.
e.g. petrol/ diesel/ gas
Ordinal: The data with categories where the categories have an order associated with them.
e.g. small/ medium/ large&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data can be described using different measures to understand the data.
They can further classify as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures of central tendency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures of dispersion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures of Central Tendency
The measures of central tendency describe where the central part of the data lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mean 
The mean is also called the average. It tells us the division point for the data.
It is given as the sum of observations divided by the number of observations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mean = sum of observations / number of observations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a calculated field.
Mean is very sensitive to the extreme values and is not considered a best metric to understand the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13
Mean = 13+18+13+14+13+16+14+21+13 / 9   = 15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Median
The median is the middle most value in the distribution of the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sort the data in ascending order
If number of observations is odd, 
Median = n+1/2 th observation
If number of observations is even.
Median = average of n/2 th observation and n/2 +1 th observation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13
13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18, 21
N = 9
Median = 9+1/2 = 5th observation = 14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a positional field.
Median is also subject to outliers or extreme values. It is affected by extreme values but not as much as the mean. Hence is a better metric than the mean in situations where mean is not a good metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mode
The most frequent value in the data is called as mode. It is a metric used for categorical features. It is not usually considered in case of numerical features.
Unimodal: The data with only one mode
Bimodal: The data with two modes
Multimodal: The data with more than two modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13
13 – 4
14 – 2
16 – 1
18 – 1
21 – 1
Mode = 13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is neither calculated nor a positional field.
Mode is not subject to outliers or extreme values. It is not affected by extreme values like mean or median.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures of dispersion
The measures of dispersion describe the spread of data that is it helps understand how the data is distributed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Range
The range is the difference between minimum and the maximum values in the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range = Maximum – Minimum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13
Range = 21-13 = 7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is affected by outliers in the data. Hence is not considered a good measure for understanding the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deviation
The difference between the observed value and the estimate of the location usually the mean. They are also called as Errors or Residuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deviation = Observed value – Estimate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13
Mean = 15
13 - 15 = -2
14 – 15 = -1
16 – 15 =1
18 – 15 =3
21 – 15 =6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard deviation
This measure how deviated the observations are from the mean and from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard deviation of population:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical deviation of sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard deviation is also affected by the outliers. Since it calculated the deviations which are also affected by the outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use n-1 to calculate for sample measures rather than n to account for the degrees of freedom. Using n with undercalculate the statistic but with n-1 will be a better explanation. The degrees of freedom are the number of observations which can be varied that is which can be moved freely. N-1 accounts to the observations that can move freely as one observation is kept constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variance:
The variance is also a spread of the data. It tells us on an average how deviated are the data points from the mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variance = standard deviation ^ 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quartile:
The data when divided into 4 equal parts gives us the quartiles. It is one of the measures of calculating the extreme values in the data. Ever quartile has equal number of observations. They contain 25% of the observations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1st quartile = n+1/4 th observation
2nd quartile = Median = n+1/2 th observation
3rd quartile = 3(n+1)/4 th observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inter quartile range
The interquartile range is the difference between the third and the first quartiles. It tells us where the 50% of the data lies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IQR = 3rd quartile – 1st quartile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is considered as one of the methods to remove the extreme values in the data.
It is given as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower limit = 1st quartile – 1.5&lt;em&gt;IQR
Upper limit = 3rd quantile + 1.5&lt;/em&gt;IQR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any value lower than lower limits or any value greater than the upper limit is considered as outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skewness
The skewness is the measure of the asymmetry of the data.
Any data can have different kinds of distributions like normal, binomial etc.
In case of normal distribution, the skewness = 0 since there symmetry around the mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skewness = 3(Mean-Median) / standard deviation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skewness can be of two types:
Right skewness / Positive skewness:
skewness&amp;gt;0
Mean &amp;gt; Median &amp;gt;Mode
It happens when there are few extreme values on the right tail of the data. 
Left skewness / Negative skewness:
Skewness&amp;lt;0
Mean&amp;lt; Median&amp;lt; Mode
It happens when there are few extreme values on the left side of the data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No skewness:
Skewness =0
Mean = Median = Mode
It happens when data is normally distributed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kurtosis
It is a measure of tailedness or the peakedness in the data. It tells us what kind of distribution the data has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive kurt: Leptokurtic:
Kurt &amp;gt;3
Excess kurt &amp;gt;0
Excess kurt =kurt -3
When the data is leptokurtic then the data lies very near to the mean or in other words, the standard deviation is low. 
Lepto means skinny and the distribution looks like a long peak.
It indicates that the extreme values or outliers are large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesokurtic: No kurt:
Kurt = 3
Excess kurt =0
When the data is mesokurtic then the data lies symmetric around the mean, in other words it is normally distributed.
It indicates that there are no outliers or extreme values in the data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Platykurtic: Negative kurt:
Kurt &amp;lt;3
Excess kurt &amp;lt;0 When the data is platykurtic then the data lies far from the mean, in other words the standard deviation is high. Platy means broad and hence distribution looks like a broad distribution. It indicates that the extreme values or outliers are small.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Covariance
The covariance is a measure of direction of movement of the variable in respect to each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only tells us the direction of movement of the variables with each other
It is not interpretable.
It can be positive or negative.
When covariance &amp;gt;0 then with an increase in one variable there will be an increase in the other variable
When covariance &amp;lt;0 then with increase in one variable there will be a decrease in the other variable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Correlation
Also called the coefficient of covariance
This is a measure of both the direction and the magnitude of the movement of the variables in respect of each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlation is preferred to covariance as it is interpretable.
It always lies between -1 and 1
If correlation =0 then there is no relation between the variables
If correlation =1 then with a unit increase in one variable there is a unit increase in another variable.
If correlation =-1 then with a unit increase in one variable there is a unit decrease in another variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlation does not mean causation.
Causation means an evet that happens because another event happens that is it is a pre-established relationship.
Correlation only implies statistically they move but not as a cause is involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DATA VSUALISATION
The visualisation of any data will help uncover better patterns in the data. And for any person visualisation is a better technique to understand the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Histogram
The plot shows the distribution of the data which is numerical in nature.
It plots the intervals against their distributions.
The bins are of equal width. 
Number of bins is dependent on the user.
The height of the bin is the frequency.
x-axis = interval
y-axis = frequency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Range = 65-12=53

Step2: Divide range into number of groups and round up
n=6

53/6 = 8.8 ~9

Step3: Use class width to create the groups
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bar plots
The plots that show the distribution of a categorical variable. It plots the frequency against the category.
X – axis = category
Y – axis = frequency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category	Frequency
G1	1
G2	2
G3	3
G4	4
G5	5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pie charts
The pie charts are circular graphs that show the distribution of the categories in the variable based on their percentages.
It plots the percentage of total observations for each category.
There are no axes to the chart
100% = 360 degrees in a pie chart
Sum of all the observation frequency percentages is 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruit	Percentage
Peach	10
Orange	13
Pineapple	20
Grapes	27
Banana	30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Box plots
One of the plots used to view the numerical data. It is called the box and whiskers plot.
It is called as 5-summary plot
It includes:
Lower limit
1st quartile
Median
3rd quartile
Upper limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the minimum and maximum values lie below the limits of the IQR range, then we cannot see the points after the whiskers (lines) in the plot.
But if the values lie above and below the limits, we can use this to see how they are distributed. In such case minimum value = least value point and maximum value = highest point in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scatter plots
The graph shows the relationship between the two continuous features. It helps us understand how two features are related to each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Binomial is when there are only two categories in the data. e.g. True/False, 0/1, male/female Multinomial is when there are more than two categories in the data. e.g. petrol/ diesel/ gas Ordinal: The data with categories where the categories have an order associated with them. e.g. small/ medium/ large   DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS The data can be described using different measures to understand the data. They can further classify as Measures of central tendency Measures of dispersion Measures of Central Tendency The measures of central tendency describe where the central part of the data lies. Mean The mean is also called the average. It tells us the division point for the data. It is given as the sum of observations divided by the number of observations. Mean = sum of observations / number of observations It is a calculated field. Mean is very sensitive to the extreme values and is not considered a best metric to understand the data. 13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 Mean = 13+18+13+14+13+16+14+21+13 / 9 = 15 Median The median is the middle most value in the distribution of the data. Sort the data in ascending order If number of observations is odd, Median = n+1/2 th observation If number of observations is even. Median = average of n/2 th observation and n/2 +1 th observation 13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18, 21 N = 9 Median = 9+1/2 = 5th observation = 14 It is a positional field. Median is also subject to outliers or extreme values. It is affected by extreme values but not as much as the mean. Hence is a better metric than the mean in situations where mean is not a good metric. Mode The most frequent value in the data is called as mode. It is a metric used for categorical features. It is not usually considered in case of numerical features. Unimodal: The data with only one mode Bimodal: The data with two modes Multimodal: The data with more than two modes 13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 13 – 4 14 – 2 16 – 1 18 – 1 21 – 1 Mode = 13 It is neither calculated nor a positional field. Mode is not subject to outliers or extreme values. It is not affected by extreme values like mean or median. Measures of dispersion The measures of dispersion describe the spread of data that is it helps understand how the data is distributed Range The range is the difference between minimum and the maximum values in the data. Range = Maximum – Minimum 13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 Range = 21-13 = 7 It is affected by outliers in the data. Hence is not considered a good measure for understanding the data. Deviation The difference between the observed value and the estimate of the location usually the mean. They are also called as Errors or Residuals. Deviation = Observed value – Estimate 13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13 Mean = 15 13 - 15 = -2 14 – 15 = -1 16 – 15 =1 18 – 15 =3 21 – 15 =6 Standard deviation This measure how deviated the observations are from the mean and from each other. Standard deviation of population: Statistical deviation of sample: Standard deviation is also affected by the outliers. Since it calculated the deviations which are also affected by the outliers. We use n-1 to calculate for sample measures rather than n to account for the degrees of freedom. Using n with undercalculate the statistic but with n-1 will be a better explanation. The degrees of freedom are the number of observations which can be varied that is which can be moved freely. N-1 accounts to the observations that can move freely as one observation is kept constant. Variance: The variance is also a spread of the data. It tells us on an average how deviated are the data points from the mean. Variance = standard deviation ^ 2 Quartile: The data when divided into 4 equal parts gives us the quartiles. It is one of the measures of calculating the extreme values in the data. Ever quartile has equal number of observations. They contain 25% of the observations. 1st quartile = n+1/4 th observation 2nd quartile = Median = n+1/2 th observation 3rd quartile = 3(n+1)/4 th observation. Inter quartile range The interquartile range is the difference between the third and the first quartiles. It tells us where the 50% of the data lies. IQR = 3rd quartile – 1st quartile It is considered as one of the methods to remove the extreme values in the data. It is given as Lower limit = 1st quartile – 1.5IQR Upper limit = 3rd quantile + 1.5IQR Any value lower than lower limits or any value greater than the upper limit is considered as outliers. Skewness The skewness is the measure of the asymmetry of the data. Any data can have different kinds of distributions like normal, binomial etc. In case of normal distribution, the skewness = 0 since there symmetry around the mean. Skewness = 3(Mean-Median) / standard deviation Skewness can be of two types: Right skewness / Positive skewness: skewness&amp;gt;0 Mean &amp;gt; Median &amp;gt;Mode It happens when there are few extreme values on the right tail of the data. Left skewness / Negative skewness: Skewness&amp;lt;0 Mean&amp;lt; Median&amp;lt; Mode It happens when there are few extreme values on the left side of the data No skewness: Skewness =0 Mean = Median = Mode It happens when data is normally distributed Kurtosis It is a measure of tailedness or the peakedness in the data. It tells us what kind of distribution the data has. Positive kurt: Leptokurtic: Kurt &amp;gt;3 Excess kurt &amp;gt;0 Excess kurt =kurt -3 When the data is leptokurtic then the data lies very near to the mean or in other words, the standard deviation is low. Lepto means skinny and the distribution looks like a long peak. It indicates that the extreme values or outliers are large. Mesokurtic: No kurt: Kurt = 3 Excess kurt =0 When the data is mesokurtic then the data lies symmetric around the mean, in other words it is normally distributed. It indicates that there are no outliers or extreme values in the data Platykurtic: Negative kurt: Kurt &amp;lt;3 Excess kurt &amp;lt;0 When the data is platykurtic then the data lies far from the mean, in other words the standard deviation is high. Platy means broad and hence distribution looks like a broad distribution. It indicates that the extreme values or outliers are small. Covariance The covariance is a measure of direction of movement of the variable in respect to each other. It only tells us the direction of movement of the variables with each other It is not interpretable. It can be positive or negative. When covariance &amp;gt;0 then with an increase in one variable there will be an increase in the other variable When covariance &amp;lt;0 then with increase in one variable there will be a decrease in the other variable Correlation Also called the coefficient of covariance This is a measure of both the direction and the magnitude of the movement of the variables in respect of each other. Correlation is preferred to covariance as it is interpretable. It always lies between -1 and 1 If correlation =0 then there is no relation between the variables If correlation =1 then with a unit increase in one variable there is a unit increase in another variable. If correlation =-1 then with a unit increase in one variable there is a unit decrease in another variable. Correlation does not mean causation. Causation means an evet that happens because another event happens that is it is a pre-established relationship. Correlation only implies statistically they move but not as a cause is involved.   DATA VSUALISATION The visualisation of any data will help uncover better patterns in the data. And for any person visualisation is a better technique to understand the data. Histogram The plot shows the distribution of the data which is numerical in nature. It plots the intervals against their distributions. The bins are of equal width. Number of bins is dependent on the user. The height of the bin is the frequency. x-axis = interval y-axis = frequency 2 14 14 14 16 18 20 20 21 23 27 27 27 29 31 31 32 32 34 36 40 40 40 40 40 42 51 56 60 65 Step1: calculate range Range = 65-12=53 Step2: Divide range into number of groups and round up n=6 53/6 = 8.8 ~9 Step3: Use class width to create the groups   Classes Frequency 12-21 8 21-30 6 30-39 6 39-48 6 48-57 2 57-66 2   Bar plots The plots that show the distribution of a categorical variable. It plots the frequency against the category. X – axis = category Y – axis = frequency Category Frequency G1 1 G2 2 G3 3 G4 4 G5 5   Pie charts The pie charts are circular graphs that show the distribution of the categories in the variable based on their percentages. It plots the percentage of total observations for each category. There are no axes to the chart 100% = 360 degrees in a pie chart Sum of all the observation frequency percentages is 100%. Fruit Percentage Peach 10 Orange 13 Pineapple 20 Grapes 27 Banana 30 Box plots One of the plots used to view the numerical data. It is called the box and whiskers plot. It is called as 5-summary plot It includes: Lower limit 1st quartile Median 3rd quartile Upper limit If the minimum and maximum values lie below the limits of the IQR range, then we cannot see the points after the whiskers (lines) in the plot. But if the values lie above and below the limits, we can use this to see how they are distributed. In such case minimum value = least value point and maximum value = highest point in the graph. Scatter plots The graph shows the relationship between the two continuous features. It helps us understand how two features are related to each other. X – axis = one variable Y – axis = another variable</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Top basic questions asked from SQL</title><link href="/sql/2020/07/01/top-sql-questions-asked-in-interview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Top basic questions asked from SQL" /><published>2020-07-01T11:57:40+00:00</published><updated>2020-07-01T11:57:40+00:00</updated><id>/sql/2020/07/01/top-sql-questions-asked-in-interview</id><content type="html" xml:base="/sql/2020/07/01/top-sql-questions-asked-in-interview/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;basics-information-in-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basics Information In SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw facts are figures are called as data. These facts are unorganized that need to be processed. It is usually random and useless until organised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. height of students in class is 150,160,142,182&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data which is processed, organised, structured and presented in a given context so as to make it useful is called information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. the average height of students in the class is 152&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATABASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A data structure that stores organised information. Most databases contain multiple tables, which may include several different fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database management system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system software for creating and managing databases. It makes it possible for the end users to read, create, update, read, update and delete data in a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. Mysql, PostreSQL, MSAccess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchial DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast and simple, records contain information about the groups of parent and child relationship like a tree structure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly used on digital computers. Computers can be made between different types of data. It is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relational DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to maintain. Depends on normalising rows and columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object Oriented DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more than storage of programming language objects It stores both data members values and operations.
&lt;strong&gt;RDBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between data files is relational. It is a DBMS designed specifically for relational databases. It stores data in form of related tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Flexibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Maintenance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Data structure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language used to communicate with the database in order to maintain and manage the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL goes hand in hand with the relational model because the result of an SQL query is a table (also called, in this context, a result set).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MYSQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is open source along with PostreSQL. Simple and easy to maintain and install. Not case sensitive like other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TERMINOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entity - Something of interest to the database user community. Examples include customers, parts, geographic locations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column - An individual piece of data stored in a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row - A set of columns that together completely describe an entity or some action on an entity. Also called a record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table - A set of rows, held either in memory (non-persistent) or on permanent storage (persistent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result set - Another name for a non-persistent table, generally the result of an SQL query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary key - One or more columns that can be used as a unique identifier for each row in a table. Foreign key - One or more columns that can be used together to identify a single row in another table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA TYPES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character -&lt;/strong&gt; can be either fixed length or variable length.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;char (20)&lt;/strong&gt; The fixed length strings are right padded with spaces and always consume same number of bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;varchar (20)&lt;/strong&gt; They are not right padded with spaces and do not allocate memory to the unused part of the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny text : maximum number of bytes 255&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;text : maximum number of bytes 65,535&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium text : maximum number of bytes 16,777,215&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long text : maximum number of bytes 4,294,967,295&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUMERIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;int :&lt;/strong&gt; integer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;decimal :&lt;/strong&gt; decimal points as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BOOLEAN&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BIT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DATE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TIME&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DATETIME&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-50-questions-asked-on-sql&quot;&gt;Top 50 questions asked on SQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What is DBMS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Database Management System (DBMS) is a program that controls creation, maintenance and use of a database. DBMS can be termed as File Manager that manages data in a database rather than saving it in file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What is RDBMS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS store the data into the collection of tables, which is related by common fields between the columns of the table. It also provides relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: SQL Server.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What is SQL?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL stands for Structured Query Language , and it is used to communicate with the Database. This is a standard language used to perform tasks such as retrieval, updation, insertion and deletion of data from a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard SQL Commands are Select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What is a Database?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Database is nothing but an organized form of data for easy access, storing, retrieval and managing of data. This is also known as structured form of data which can be accessed in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: School Management Database, Bank Management Database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. What are tables and Fields?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A table is a set of data that are organized in a model with Columns and Rows. Columns can be categorized as vertical, and Rows are horizontal. A table has specified number of column called fields but can have any number of rows which is called record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table: Employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Field: Emp ID, Emp Name, Date of Birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data: 201456, David, 11/15/1960.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What is a primary key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL constraint. It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. What is a unique key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Unique key constraint uniquely identified each record in the database. This provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Primary key constraint has automatic unique constraint defined on it. But not, in the case of Unique Key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be many unique constraint defined per table, but only one Primary key constraint defined per table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. What is a foreign key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A foreign key is one table which can be related to the primary key of another table. Relationship needs to be created between two tables by referencing foreign key with the primary key of another table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. What is a join?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a keyword used to query data from more tables based on the relationship between the fields of the tables. Keys play a major role when JOINs are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. What are the types of join and explain each?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various types of join which can be used to retrieve data and it depends on the relationship between tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner Join.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inner join return rows when there is at least one match of rows between the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Join.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right join return rows which are common between the tables and all rows of Right hand side table. Simply, it returns all the rows from the right hand side table even though there are no matches in the left hand side table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Join.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left join return rows which are common between the tables and all rows of Left hand side table. Simply, it returns all the rows from Left hand side table even though there are no matches in the Right hand side table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Join.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full join return rows when there are matching rows in any one of the tables. This means, it returns all the rows from the left hand side table and all the rows from the right hand side table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. What is normalization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database. The main aim of Normalization is to add, delete or modify field that can be made in a single table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. What is Denormalization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeNormalization is a technique used to access the data from higher to lower normal forms of database. It is also process of introducing redundancy into a table by incorporating data from the related tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. What are all the different normalizations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal forms can be divided into 5 forms, and they are explained below -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Normal Form (1NF):.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables for the related data and identification of unique columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Normal Form (2NF):.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting all requirements of the first normal form. Placing the subsets of data in separate tables and Creation of relationships between the tables using primary keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Normal Form (3NF):.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should meet all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not dependent on primary key constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Normal Form (4NF):.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting all the requirements of third normal form and it should not have multi- valued dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. What is a View?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. Views are not virtually present, and it takes less space to store. View can have data of one or more tables combined, and it is depending on the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. What is an Index?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An index is performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from the table. An index creates an entry for each value and it will be faster to retrieve data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. What are all the different types of indexes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of indexes -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Index.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indexing does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. Unique index can be applied automatically when primary key is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustered Index.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of index reorders the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. Each table can have only one clustered index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NonClustered Index.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NonClustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains logical order of data. Each table can have 999 nonclustered indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. What is a Cursor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A database Cursor is a control which enables traversal over the rows or records in the table. This can be viewed as a pointer to one row in a set of rows. Cursor is very much useful for traversing such as retrieval, addition and removal of database records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. What is a relationship and what are they?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Database Relationship is defined as the connection between the tables in a database. There are various data basing relationships, and they are as follows:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One to One Relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One to Many Relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many to One Relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-Referencing Relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. What is a query?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DB query is a code written in order to get the information back from the database. Query can be designed in such a way that it matched with our expectation of the result set. Simply, a question to the Database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. What is subquery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query, and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed first, and the result of subquery is passed on to the main query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. What are the types of subquery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of subquery – Correlated and Non-Correlated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correlated subquery cannot be considered as independent query, but it can refer the column in a table listed in the FROM the list of the main query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Non-Correlated sub query can be considered as independent query and the output of subquery are substituted in the main query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22. What is a stored procedure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stored Procedure is a function consists of many SQL statement to access the database system. Several SQL statements are consolidated into a stored procedure and execute them whenever and wherever required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23. What is a trigger?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DB trigger is a code or programs that automatically execute with response to some event on a table or view in a database. Mainly, trigger helps to maintain the integrity of the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: When a new student is added to the student database, new records should be created in the related tables like Exam, Score and Attendance tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DELETE command is used to remove rows from the table, and WHERE clause can be used for conditional set of parameters. Commit and Rollback can be performed after delete statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table. Truncate operation cannot be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25. What are local and global variables and their differences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local variables are the variables which can be used or exist inside the function. They are not known to the other functions and those variables cannot be referred or used. Variables can be created whenever that function is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global variables are the variables which can be used or exist throughout the program. Same variable declared in global cannot be used in functions. Global variables cannot be created whenever that function is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26. What is a constraint?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constraint can be used to specify the limit on the data type of table. Constraint can be specified while creating or altering the table statement. Sample of constraint are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NOT NULL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CHECK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DEFAULT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UNIQUE.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PRIMARY KEY.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FOREIGN KEY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27. What is data Integrity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. It can also define integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into the application or database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. What is Auto Increment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto increment keyword allows the user to create a unique number to be generated when a new record is inserted into the table. AUTO INCREMENT keyword can be used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword can be used in SQL SERVER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly this keyword can be used whenever PRIMARY KEY is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29. What is the difference between Cluster and Non-Cluster Index?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clustered index is used for easy retrieval of data from the database by altering the way that the records are stored. Database sorts out rows by the column which is set to be clustered index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nonclustered index does not alter the way it was stored but creates a complete separate object within the table. It point back to the original table rows after searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30. What is Datawarehouse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datawarehouse is a central repository of data from multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available for the mining and online processing. Warehouse data have a subset of data called Data Marts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31. What is Self-Join?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-join is set to be query used to compare to itself. This is used to compare values in a column with other values in the same column in the same table. ALIAS ES can be used for the same table comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32. What is Cross-Join?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross join defines as Cartesian product where number of rows in the first table multiplied by number of rows in the second table. If suppose, WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33. What is user defined functions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User defined functions are the functions written to use that logic whenever required. It is not necessary to write the same logic several times. Instead, function can be called or executed whenever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34. What are all types of user defined functions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three types of user defined functions are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scalar Functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inline Table valued functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multi statement valued functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalar returns unit, variant defined the return clause. Other two types return table as a return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35. What is collation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collation is defined as set of rules that determine how character data can be sorted and compared. This can be used to compare A and, other language characters and also depends on the width of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASCII value can be used to compare these character data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36. What are all different types of collation sensitivity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are different types of collation sensitivity -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case Sensitivity – A and a and B and b.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accent Sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kana Sensitivity – Japanese Kana characters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Width Sensitivity – Single byte character and double byte character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37. Advantages and Disadvantages of Stored Procedure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stored procedure can be used as a modular programming – means create once, store and call for several times whenever required. This supports faster execution instead of executing multiple queries. This reduces network traffic and provides better security to the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantage is that it can be executed only in the Database and utilizes more memory in the database server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38. What is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) manages transaction based applications which can be used for data entry, data retrieval and data processing. OLTP makes data management simple and efficient. Unlike OLAP systems goal of OLTP systems is serving real-time transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example – Bank Transactions on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39. What is CLAUSE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL clause is defined to limit the result set by providing condition to the query. This usually filters some rows from the whole set of records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example – Query that has WHERE condition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Query that has HAVING condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40. What is recursive stored procedure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stored procedure which calls by itself until it reaches some boundary condition. This recursive function or procedure helps programmers to use the same set of code any number of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41. What is Union, minus and Interact commands?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNION operator is used to combine the results of two tables, and it eliminates duplicate rows from the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MINUS operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the second query. Matching records of first and second query and other rows from the first query will be displayed as a result set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42. What is an ALIAS command?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALIAS name can be given to a table or column. This alias name can be referred in WHERE clause to identify the table or column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select st.StudentID, Ex.Result from student st, Exam as Ex where st.studentID = Ex. StudentID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, st refers to alias name for student table and Ex refers to alias name for exam table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43. What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DROP statements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUNCATE removes all the rows from the table, and it cannot be rolled back. DROP command removes a table from the database and operation cannot be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44. What are aggregate and scalar functions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregate functions are used to evaluate mathematical calculation and return single values. This can be calculated from the columns in a table. Scalar functions return a single value based on the input value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregate – max(), count - Calculated with respect to numeric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalar – UCASE(), NOW() – Calculated with respect to strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45. How can you create an empty table from an existing table?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example will be -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select * into studentcopy from student where 1=2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we are copying student table to another table with the same structure with no rows copied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46. How to fetch common records from two tables?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common records result set can be achieved by -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select studentID from student. &lt;strong&gt;INTERSECT &lt;/strong&gt; Select StudentID from Exam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47. How to fetch alternate records from a table?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Records can be fetched for both Odd and Even row numbers -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To display even numbers-.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;studentId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowno&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;studentId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowno&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To display odd numbers-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;studentId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowno&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;studentId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowno&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowno&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;studentId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowno&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48. How to select unique records from a table?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select unique records from a table by using DISTINCT keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select DISTINCT StudentID, Student_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name from Student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49. What is the command used to fetch first 5 characters of the string?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to fetch first 5 characters of the string -.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Student_Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LEFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Student_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50. Which operator is used in query for pattern matching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIKE operator is used for pattern matching, and it can be used as -.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;% - Matches zero or more characters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_(Underscore) – Matching exactly one character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example -.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;student_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a%'&lt;/span&gt;

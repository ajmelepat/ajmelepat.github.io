**Knn?**

It is a supervised learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression.

It is mainly used for classification predictions.

It can be defined as :

***Lazy learner:***

It is a lazy learning algorithm because it does not have a training phase

***Non parametric:***

It is non parametric as it does not have any underlying assumptions.

Imp: scaling is important for a KNN algorithm



***Working:***

The knn algorithm helps predict the unseen data based on the neighbours selected.

**Step1:** loading the dataset

**Step2:** choose the k nearest neighbours. It can be any integer.

When the k value is 1, it overfits as it is applying the value of the most nearest neighbour to the new point.

But if k is equal to n, it underfits as it is applying the average value of the dependent feature to the new point.

K value can be anyway around less than 10% of the observations.

**Step3:** for each point in the test data:

* Distance between the test point and the training data points with the help of Euclidean, Manhattan or hamming distance. The most common used method to calculate distance id Euclidean.
* Based on the distance value, sort them in ascending order
* Choose top k rows from the sorted array
* Assign the class based on majority or the average in case of regression





**Pros:**

* Very simple to interpret and understand
* No assumptions underlying the data
* Versatile cause it can be used for both classification and regression
* Relatively high accuracy



**Cons:**

* Computationally bit expensive algorithm
* High memory storage
* Prediction is slow in case of large number of observations
* Very sensitive to scale of data as well as irrelevant features.



***Applications:***

Banking approval: to predict weather an individual is fit for loan approval?

Does the individual have same characteristics as defaulters?

Knn can be used for

* Speech recognition
* Handwriting detection
* Image recognition
* Video recognition
